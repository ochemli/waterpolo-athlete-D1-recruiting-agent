  "strengths": "Based on the footage (NDC Camp & NCL Game) and her trajectory, here is the breakdown of her elite competencies.\n\n1. Technical: \"Quiet\" Mechanics\n\nVertical Stability: She generates lift from her legs without \"bobbing\" her head. This is rare for her age. Most 18U goalies signal they are about to jump by dipping their head; Yasmine stays level, which disguises her timing from the shooter.\n\nEconomy of Motion: She does not over-react to pump fakes. She trusts her wingspan (5'11.5\") and holds her line until the release. This forces shooters to make a perfect shot rather than relying on her to make a mistake.\n\nRebound Absorption: In the camp footage, she catches or drops the ball directly in front of her (\"dead blocking\") less often than she tips it to safety. This prevents second-chance goals.\n\n2. Physical: Structural Leverage\n\nThe \"Ape Index\": Her +2.5\" wingspan advantage allows her to cover the high corners (the \"top shelf\") with less lateral explosion than a shorter-armed goalie. She essentially shrinks the cage.\n\nQ4 Durability: The Shadow game footage proves she does not lose leg height when fatigued. This is the primary physical filter for NCAA recruiters—many goalies sink 2-3 inches in the final quarter; she stays high.\n\n3. Behavioral: Defensive Command\n\nSystem Administration: She is audible and directive. She organizes the defense before the shot is taken, specifically during transition (swimming back). She acts as a coordinator, not just a shot-stopper.\n\nPsychological Resilience: Captaining an 18U team as a 2027 graduate confirms she can command respect from older peers. This \"playing up\" capability suggests she will handle the transition to a collegiate locker room without shrinking socially or competitively.\n\nSummary: She is a \"high-floor\" recruit. Her physical dimensions and technical discipline make her a safe bet for a D1 coach, while her leadership trajectory suggests she can become a franchise player by her sophomore year.",
